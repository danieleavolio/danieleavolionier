# Photographer Website

## Description
Website made using plain HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's a website for my photographer fiancee. I just wanted to try Bootstrap since I know is a very popular framework and I wanted to see how it works. I also used some Javascript to make the website more dynamic.

## Technologies
I just used:

| Name | Motivation |
| ------ | ------ |
| HTML | To create the structure of the website |
| CSS | To style the website |
| Javascript | To make the website more dynamic |
| Bootstrap | To make the website responsive |


To be honest, if I could start over, I would use a framework like React, Vue or Svelte, because is far more easy to maintain and to add new features. I also would use a CSS preprocessor like SASS or LESS, because it's easier to style the website and to maintain the code.
