# Second Personal Website

## Description
This was my **second personal website** I made. I was so proud of it, in fact it has been my **main website** since 2 weeks from the writing of this project page. 

I wanted ot create something **pretty, minimalistic** but **functional and different** from the previous one. I added some pages that were not present in the previous, I added a **manual switch for light and dark mode**, I added a **lot of content**. I will write them in the next paragraph.

## Technologies

I used a lot of technologies in this project, but the main ones are:

| Name | Motivation |
| ------ | ------ |
| SvelteKit | My favourite framework and the one I know the most |
| TailwindCSS | I used it in the past and I got used to it. I also like it a lot |
| GraphCMS | I wanted to try a headless CMS and I found this one. It's very easy to use and it has a lot of features. It's a bit strange to setup but it's very powerful |

## Features
I wanted to add a lot of features to this website, and I did it. I added:

### Posts and Projects
I used GraphCMS to write **posts** and have something like a **blog**. There was a dedicated page and a **tag handling** system implemented in SvelteKit, that filtered the content based on the tag clicked.

I used the same structure to show **projects**. I added a **filtering system** to show only the projects I wanted to show using tags.

### Notes

I had in mind a page to upload my **University Notes**, since I started to take notes with my computer, but I never had the time to do it. Maybe in the future here? Who knows..

### Resume Page

I added a resume page that had a *timeline* showing each milestone I achieved in my life. It was *enough cool* but **not so much cool** to handle and maintain it..

## Conclusion

Overall, the project was a lot **messy** and **hard to maintain**. I had to write a lot of code to handle the **filtering** and the **tag system**. I also had to write a lot of code to handle *Tailwind*, because I decided to add it later. 

However, I was very proud of it and I used it for a lot of time. I also learned a lot of things, like how to use a headless CMS, how to use TailwindCSS and how to handle a lot of pages in SvelteKit.
