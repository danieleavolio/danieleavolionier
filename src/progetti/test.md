# First Personal Website
A very simple personal website I made using SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS.

I used **Netlify** to deploy the website, because at the time I only knew that platform.

## Technologies

It was a classic website, using a color palette I don't like anymore: *green and blue*. Now I prefer more minimalistic colors. 

I used **SvelteKit** because my thesis advisor suggested me to use it, and I was curious about it. I used **Tailwind CSS** because I wanted to try it, and I liked it a lot. By the way, the project used an old version of SvelteKit, infact I will not update it anymore, of course.

The mobile version was not so good, but I didn't know how to make it better at the time, because I had so little experience with Tailwind. I knew CSS, but I didn't know how to use it with Tailwind in the good way.
