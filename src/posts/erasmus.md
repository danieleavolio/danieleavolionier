# The beginning

What's up everyone! I am Daniele and I'm just writing this to make this website a little bit more alive. I'm currently in Lisbon, Portugal, for an Erasmus experience. I'm studying at the **Instituto Superior Técnico** and having a little **hard** time with the period system they have here.

Right now is going kinda well, but I'm still trying to figure out how to actually LIVE. I mean, I'm not used to this kind of life, so I'm trying to adapt as much as I can.

## Instituto Superior Técnico

The university is really cool, and at the same time, it's really hard. I'm studying **Electrical and Computer Engineering** and I'm actually having fun with the subjects. I mean, there is this thing called **Julia** that's kinda MHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
But at least, I'm having fun with the **programming** subjects. Having time to develope new skills in *Information Retrival* and *Compilers* is really cool. Luckily I was in a group with GOD himself that helped me a lot with the Julia thing. Also the Information Retrieval is cool, and the project was very interesting.

Just wanted to put the clustering photo here.

## The city

**Lisbon** is amazing. It feels reeeeally *safe* for being a capital and the people are pretty chill. I actually didn't meet that much of portoguese people, but the ones I met were really nice. Also a lot of Erasmus students are here, and I mean A LOT. Italians, Germans, Spanish, North Europeans, and so on. Shout out to Teo for being crazy and kind guy. Yeah shout out even to Michele aka **Maiku22** for being with me here, even if he's a little bit dormiendes.

## The future

Yeah I should be working on my thesis, but for **some unfortunate events** I'm still waiting. I don't have a particular topic in mind, even if there is some that has my interest. Of course it's something related to *Artificial Intelligence*, more focused on some Deep Learning stuff. I'm actually waiting to see if all the exams are going well, and then I will start to think about it. 

I don't have that much to say, but I will try to keep this updated. I'm also trying to write some articles about some stuff I'm learning, so stay tuned! Here is a photo of a pidgeon.
