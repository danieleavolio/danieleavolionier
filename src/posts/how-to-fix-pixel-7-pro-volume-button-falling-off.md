# Problem assessment
If you own a *Pixel 7 Pro*, I really hope you don't have this problem in the first place. However, if you are here, you probably 
searching for a solution to this problem. I'm so sad that a flagship that costs around **900€** has such a problem.

 I really hope
that Google with the next generation of Pixel phones will spend more money on the **manufacturing process and quality control**.

It looks like the **glue or sponge thing** that used to hold the button in place is **not strong enough**. I don't know if it's a problem of the **glue** or the **sponge** itself. However, it's a **big problem** because you can **lose** the button and **not be able to change the volume**.

# How to fix it

In order to fix the problem, you can choose between some options:

- **Send it in for repair**: If you are enough **patient** and you **don't want to risk to break** your phone, you can send it in for repair. However, the process is in the **matter of weeks** and, probably, you will **loose all your data**. If you are interested in this option, you can check out the official [Google support page](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7109524?hl=en)

- **Chad fix**: If you are a **Chad** and you don't care about your phone, you
can try to fix it by yourself! This *looks scarier than it is*. 

## Chad solution

### What you need

- Pixel 7 Pro (Possibly with a broken volume button)
- An Aliexpress Account
- A credit card
- A Pixel 7 Pro volume button replacement

### Steps

- Go to [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/) and search for *Pixel 7 Pro volume button*.

- Choose one from the list and just buy it. Important, be sure to check that the model is **Pixel 7 Pro** and not **Pixel 7**. I saw that the buttons are quite different, so be careful.
    
    
    - Pixel 7 **WRONG ONE**

  - You can even choose to buy a *different color*. I bought a **black** one because I think it looks better than the **white** one, and it's actually working.


- Wait for the package to arrive. The **average waiting time is >= 2 weeks**. It depends on the country you live in.

- When the package arrives, you can start the repair process. Read carefully the next steps in order to avoid any problem.

    - **Remove** old volume button
    - **Insert** new volume button
    - **Enjoy** your phone

- End 

## That's all folks

Here is a picture of my phone with the new volume button.

It's sad that a fast way to fix this is to buy a cheap volume button from Aliexpress after speding around **1k €** for a phone. The phone is **fantastic** and I never had any problem with it, but goddamn, this is a **big problem**.

*If I have any problems in the future I will update the article*
