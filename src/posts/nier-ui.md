# On-the-Fly Change

I've decided to transition from a _completely dark_ color palette to a _slightly different_ one. I've shifted from an entirely dark theme with occasional accents of lighter colors here and there to a fully light theme inspired by **NieR Automata**.

## How I Did It

I have to thank the user who created this **project** on [CodePen](https://www.codepen.io), which helped me understand how to structure everything.

You can find the project directly at this link: [SOURCE](https://codepen.io/levise/pen/vMzEwr).

I'm really loving how the project is turning out, even though I still _don't know exactly what to post_. For now, let's just say that I'm spending time writing posts and building the website's structure. I must admit I've always wanted to create something in the style of **NieR:Automata**.

### Idea for the Future

I literally just had an idea while writing this post! Maybe I can add a component to the site that displays post content in a summarized form, highlighting the **headers**. I don't know how to do it yet, but technically it should be very doable.

- Add a component to display post content in a summarized form
- Add a search for posts by tag
- Add a search for posts by date
- Win the lottery and get 10,000â‚¬
