### Favorite games
#### NieR: Automata:
My favorite game of all time. I really like the story and the characters. The gameplay is also very good and the soundtrack is amazing. I really love the author, **Yoko Taro**!

#### NieR: Replicant:
The prequel of NieR: Automata. I really like the story and the characters. The gameplay is not so good, since is a remaster of a game from 2010, but the soundtrack is amazing. The work of **Keiichi Okabe** is really good! I really suggest to play this game if you liked NieR: Automata.

#### The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
This is the first *The Legend Of Zelda* game I played. I really like the open world and the freedom you have. The story is a little bit cheap, but is not the main selling point of the game. The gameplay and the freedom of choice is extraordinary. Probably the best Switch game, without considering *Tears of the Kingdom*.

### Favorite Manga and Anime
| Type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manga Anime | Shingeki no Kyojin | My favorite manga of all time. The story, the plot, the characters, the plot twists during the story, everything is perfect. I really suggest to read it. Moreover, this is the first manga of **Hajime Isayama**! |
| Manga | Berserk | The story is very good, but the art style is amazing. The author, **Kentaro Miura**, is a genius. I really suggest to read it. A must read for every manga reader. |
| Manga Anime | Jujutsu Kaisen | A very interesting opera. The characters are very well written and the story is very good. The author, **Gege Akutami**, is very young, but he is very talented. At the moment (2023), the manga is still ongoing. |
